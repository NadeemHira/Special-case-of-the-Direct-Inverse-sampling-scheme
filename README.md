# Special-case-of-the-Direct-Inverse-sampling-scheme

A successful clinical trial requires efficient strategies for enrolling and retaining the study 
participants. However, experts of clinical trials worldwide find it extremely challenging to recruit 
and retain participants and considers it one of the major problems for the clinical trial 
termination. Therefore, this paper focuses on the simple idea of participant enrollment using
Bernoulli samples since it is cost effective. The participants are enrolled in the clinical trials 
using the Direct or Inverse Binomial sampling schemes and the point estimate for the cross-
product ratio œÅ=(p1(1-p2))/(p2(1-p1)) is calculated. Prior studies in this domain indicate that the special case 
of the Direct-Inverse sampling scheme works the best, where the number of successes in the 
Direct sampling scheme is used in the second sampling scheme of the Inverse binomial scheme. 
Asymptotic confidence intervals are constructed. Our goal is to investigate the cases when the 
normal approximations for estimators of the cross-product ratio are reliable for the construction 
of confidence intervals. We use the closeness of the confidence coefficient to the nominal 
confidence level as our main evaluation criterion, and use the Monte-Carlo method to investigate 
the key probability characteristics of intervals. We present estimations of the coverage 
probability and interval width in tables. In the last section, CYP-GUIDES case study is discussed 
where the standard and genetically guided therapy are compared and estimates for the cross-
product ratio are presented and interpreted when the participants are enrolled according to the 
special case of Direct-Inverse sampling scheme.

## Coding
For Coding, I used R program to determine the estimates of rho-hat for both simulations and 
case study estimates.
